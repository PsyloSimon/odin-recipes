Hello there,

I am very overwhelmed, however i am enjoying it thoroughly and i cant stop learning. My curiosity keeps pulling me towards the end of this course.

I have learned how to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.I am temped to switch to Ubuntu permanently. I have learned about the terminal,I have a lot to learn but at least I can create, delete, copy and navigate somewhat though the terminal. I have also learned what GitHub is and how Git works, I understand the fundamentals of Git repos.

I do however need to work this state of content creation into muscle memory. Practice makes perfect. and the more you push yourself the more you learn.
